- 👋 Hi, I’m @einarbo
- 👀 I’m interested in music. I'm working with pupils who can't use ordinary musical instruments or need instruments which are easy to play.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python - totally new to it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make software for doing simple musical tasks, using MIDI files and MIDI keyboards. e.g. make a coloured MIDI keyboard to play music following a coloured score on a PC screen.
